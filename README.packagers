This information is intended for package mantainers.

First of all, thanks for packaging this software! If you encounter
any issues which you think should be fixed upstream, please report
a bug or send a patch, I'll be happy to accept it if it makes sense.

Notes
=====
This is a collection of notes about what might be of interest,
related to packaging.

Conflict with other versions (IMPORTANT)
----------------------------------------
The python3 version of kdev-python can NOT be installed alongside other versions.
Please ensure that a package containing the e.g. 1.6 release conflicts with
a package containing 1.6-py3.
I am working on eventually lifting this annoyance in the future.

Python fork
-----------
This branch, which contains the python3 version of kdev-python, does no longer
contain a fork of python. Instead, it links against your system's python.
Python is both a build- and a runtime dependency of this program.

documentation_data directory
----------------------------
This directory does NOT contain user documentation for the plugin.
It MUST be packaged together with the program, as it contains runtime
data which is necessary for the program to work correctly (such as
representations of python's built-in data types, which are then read
by the parser etc.).
